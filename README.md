+ **Gender**: It appears that gender did not exhibit any noteworthy patterns and had no impact on attrition.
+ Stock Options Level: the **higher of banding level** for stock options that employee has, **the less likely** they would depart
+ Distance to Office: Observing that the majority of departing employees reside at a significant distance from the office (beyond 45km), it is understandable since over 60% of the company's employees actually live over 45km away from the office.
<br> **IN CONCLUSION:**
<br> The company is facing a higher attrition rate of 16% compared to the standard rate of 12.9%. Most of the employees leaving are qualified individuals between the ages of 18 and 35, and they tend to leave within the first two years of joining the company. 
<br> The higher of banding level for stock options that employee has, the less likely they would depart
<br> => Can be considered as one of the way to retain employees.
<br> The Technology and Sales departments experience the highest number of departures, especially in roles like Data Scientists and Sales Executives. 
<br> -> To address this problem, it is necessary to gather more data and conduct a detailed analysis to identify the reasons behind the team's resignations and come up with effective solutions.
